## 🔬 Failed Experiments Documentation

### 1. ARIMA/GARCH Models
```markdown
# Experiment: ARIMA/GARCH for Volatility Forecasting

## Objective
Use traditional time series models (ARIMA for mean, GARCH for volatility) to forecast realized volatility.

## Methodology
- **Data**: Daily realized volatility from 1-minute bars
- **Model**: ARIMA(1,1,1) + GARCH(1,1)
- **Training**: Rolling window with 252-day lookback
- **Evaluation**: RMSE, MAE, directional accuracy

## Results
- **RMSE**: 0.0456 (poor)
- **R²**: 0.12 (very low)
- **Directional Accuracy**: 52% (barely better than random)

## Issues
1. **Non-stationarity**: Volatility series highly non-stationary
2. **Regime changes**: Market volatility regimes change frequently
3. **Non-linear patterns**: Linear models can't capture complex patterns
4. **Parameter instability**: Model parameters change over time

## Lessons Learned
- Traditional time series models insufficient for volatility forecasting
- Need non-linear, adaptive models
- Market regime changes require dynamic models
- Volatility clustering better captured by neural networks

## Status: FAILURE - Poor predictive performance
```

### 2. Random Forest for Price Prediction
```markdown
# Experiment: Random Forest for Stock Price Prediction

## Objective
Use ensemble methods (Random Forest) to predict stock price movements based on technical indicators.

## Methodology
- **Data**: Daily OHLCV + 20 technical indicators
- **Model**: Random Forest with 100 trees
- **Features**: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Volume indicators
- **Target**: Next day price direction (up/down)

## Results
- **Accuracy**: 54% (slightly better than random)
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 0.3 (poor risk-adjusted returns)
- **Max Drawdown**: 25% (high risk)

## Issues
1. **Market Efficiency**: Price movements largely unpredictable
2. **Feature Engineering**: Technical indicators may be lagging
3. **Overfitting**: Model memorized training data
4. **Transaction Costs**: High turnover reduced net returns

## Lessons Learned
- Direct price prediction extremely difficult
- Technical indicators have limited predictive power
- Need to focus on relative value, not absolute prediction
- Transaction costs critical for strategy viability

## Status: FAILURE - Insufficient alpha generation
```

### 3. LSTM for Price Prediction
```markdown
# Experiment: LSTM for Stock Price Prediction

## Objective
Use deep learning (LSTM) to predict stock price movements with sequence modeling.

## Methodology
- **Data**: 60-day price sequences + technical indicators
- **Model**: 2-layer LSTM (64, 32 units) + Dense layers
- **Training**: 70/15/15 split with early stopping
- **Target**: Next day return prediction

## Results
- **RMSE**: 0.0234 (good fit)
- **R²**: 0.08 (low predictive power)
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 0.8 (moderate)
- **Overfitting**: Significant gap between train/validation

## Issues
1. **Noise vs Signal**: Price movements mostly noise
2. **Regime Dependence**: Model performance varies by market conditions
3. **Feature Relevance**: Many features may be irrelevant
4. **Temporal Decay**: Model performance degrades over time

## Lessons Learned
- LSTM can fit historical data but poor out-of-sample prediction
- Need to focus on volatility/risk rather than price direction
- Model retraining critical for maintaining performance
- Feature selection more important than model complexity

## Status: FAILURE - Poor out-of-sample performance
```

### 4. Transformer Models
```markdown
# Experiment: Transformer for Time Series Forecasting

## Objective
Apply transformer architecture (attention mechanisms) to financial time series forecasting.

## Methodology
- **Data**: Multi-variate time series (price, volume, indicators)
- **Model**: Transformer with 8 attention heads, 6 layers
- **Training**: Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling
- **Target**: Multi-step ahead forecasting

## Results
- **Training Time**: 4x longer than LSTM
- **Memory Usage**: 8GB GPU required
- **Performance**: Similar to LSTM but more complex
- **Interpretability**: Attention weights difficult to interpret

## Issues
1. **Computational Cost**: Expensive to train and deploy
2. **Data Requirements**: Needs large datasets for effective training
3. **Overfitting**: Complex model prone to overfitting
4. **Interpretability**: Black box nature limits trust

## Lessons Learned
- Transformers overkill for financial time series
- LSTM sufficient for most applications
- Computational efficiency important for practical deployment
- Simpler models often more robust

## Status: FAILURE - Excessive complexity for marginal gains
```
