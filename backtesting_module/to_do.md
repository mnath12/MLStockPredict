# MLStockPredict - Focused TODO List

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE PRIORITY

### 1. Diagnose Rebalancing Issues (CRITICAL)
- [x] **Investigate why delta is ~1000 instead of ~0** ✅ DIAGNOSED & FIXED
  - [x] Review portfolio delta calculation: `current_portfolio_delta = (current_call_qty * call_delta + current_put_qty * put_delta + current_stock_qty)`
  - [x] Check if stock quantity is being calculated correctly (should be -1000 for delta hedge)
  - [x] Verify straddle delta calculation: `straddle_delta = call_delta + put_delta` (should be ~0 for ATM straddle)
  - [x] Debug why initial position shows "Stock hedge: 1000 TSLA" instead of negative value
  - [x] Check if Greeks calculation is using correct implied volatility
  - [x] **ROOT CAUSE FOUND**: User selected asymmetric straddle (Call: $350, Put: $300)
  - [x] **SOLUTION**: Added validation to warn users about asymmetric straddles
  - [x] **FIXED**: Straddle delta calculation corrected from `call_delta - put_delta` to `call_delta + put_delta`

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Portfolio Delta Calculation Fix
```python
# Current issue: Portfolio delta is ~1000 instead of ~0
# Debug this calculation:
current_portfolio_delta = (current_call_qty * call_delta + 
                          current_put_qty * put_delta + 
                          current_stock_qty)

# Expected values for ATM straddle:
# call_delta ≈ 0.5, put_delta ≈ -0.5 (for ATM options)
# straddle_delta = call_delta - put_delta ≈ 1.0
# stock_qty should be -straddle_delta * 100 * straddle_qty = -1000
# So portfolio_delta should be: (-10 * 0.5) + (-10 * -0.5) + (-1000) ≈ -1000
```

### Straddle Strategy Validation
```python
# Verify ATM straddle implementation:
def validate_straddle_setup(self, call_delta, put_delta, stock_qty):
    """
    Validate that straddle is properly delta-neutral
    """
    straddle_delta = call_delta - put_delta  # Should be ~1.0 for ATM
    expected_stock_qty = -straddle_delta * 100 * straddle_qty
    portfolio_delta = (call_qty * call_delta + put_qty * put_delta + stock_qty)
    return abs(portfolio_delta) < 0.1  # Should be close to 0
```

### Sharpe Ratio Fix
```python
# Potential issues to check
def calculate_sharpe_ratio(self, returns, risk_free_rate):
    """
    Ensure proper Sharpe ratio calculation
    """
    excess_returns = returns - risk_free_rate
    if np.std(excess_returns) == 0:
        return 0
    return np.mean(excess_returns) / np.std(excess_returns)
```

### Rolling Window LSTM Integration
```python
# Rolling window approach for volatility forecasting
def rolling_window_forecast(self, model, data, window_size, retrain_freq):
    """
    Implement expanding window with periodic retraining
    """
    predictions = []
    for i in range(window_size, len(data)):
        # Train on expanding window
        if i % retrain_freq == 0:
            model.fit(data[:i])
        
        # Predict next value
        pred = model.predict(data[i-window_size:i])
        predictions.append(pred)
    return predictions
```
